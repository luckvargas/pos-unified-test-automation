# pos-unified-test-automation
Pos Unified Test Automation is the core of a robotic system to automate chip and pin transactions in a POS (Point of Sale) terminals. It uses computer vision to identify keypad and elements on terminal screen. Also it uses a CNC with a capacitive stylus attached for physical interactions with the terminal and a custom module for card insertion and swipe.

This software is part of an Final Graduation Project (in progress) on Electronic Engineering at [Federal University of Rio de Janeiro](http://www.poli.ufrj.br/).
